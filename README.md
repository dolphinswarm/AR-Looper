# AR Looper
AR Looper is an augmented reality application, developed using Unity and Vuforia. This application allows people to point their phone at a printed-out piece of paper and make their own simple music loops. Users can select from five instrument sets, with five instruments per set (25 instruments total). Users can also add a lowpass, highpass, and reverb filters to their remix.

You may be asking to yourself, "why do you need AR for this?" Initially, this project was conceived to be a mobile launchpad / keyboard for on-the-go music composition and arrangement, but we felt that AR technology wasn't good enough to achieve our desired effect. We found that Vuforia's buttons were a lot less responsive than initially planned, so we had to scale our project down to be a loop machine. Maybe AR technology will be good enough one day to allow for a cheap and mobile AR launchpad?
